/*
 It contains functions for creating both servers and clients (called streams).
 The socket is the channel of the communication between any two programs (which can be on the same machine or distributed system). The socket contains a IP address and a port number (which should be unique, no two processes can use the same port on the same physical address space).
 The sockets can be written data to or read from.
 There are two categories of TCP socket programs you can write - i. server, ii. client. A TCP server listens for connections to it from clients and send data to the client. A TCP client connects to a TCP server exchange data with it.
 The communication between client and server happens via sockets.
